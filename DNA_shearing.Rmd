## 4. DNA shearing

#### Materials

DNA concentration kit  
Ultrapure dH2O  
Covaris S220  
TC13 Covaris tubes (KBioscience #KBS-0073-100/ Life Technologies #4399054)  
Agilent, 2100 Bioanalyser   
Agilent Bioanalyser High Sensitivity DNA kit (Agilent, #5067-4626)  
Caliper LifeSciences, LabChip GX  
HT DNA 1K/12K/Hi Sens Lab Chip, (Caliper LifeSciences,  # 760517).  
HT DNA hiSens Reagent Kit, (Caliper LifeSciences,  # CLS760672).  
Nucleospin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit, (Machery Nagel, #740609.50)  

#### Preparation

* samples have to be concentrated to 52.5 $\mu$l (maximum for the covaris tube)
* Use [Genomic DNA Clean and Concentrator columns](http://www.zymoresearch.com/downloads/dl/file/id/35/d4003i.pdf) (Ampure beads don´t workwell for large DNA fragments)

#### Protocol for Genomic DNA clean and concentrator columns (see link to protocol for preparation of reagents)
** work on this section again!**
1. Pool each library (16 samples) in a big tube
2. Pooled volume is 960 $\mu$l (16 samples * 60 $\mu$l)
3. Add 2x as much Buffer to the volume of the pooled DNA (2 * 960 ul)
4. Has to be done 3 times (for this volume), as each eppi can just hold 1000 ul
+ Let dna stay in the top, get rid of fluid at the bottom, fill in again
5. 20 ul elution buffer added 3 times and spinned
