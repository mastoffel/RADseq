Protocol based on Fuentes-Utrilla (unpublished), which is based on Etter et al (2011 Methods Mol Biol 772:157-78) and on Baird et al (2008 PloS ONE 3:e3376). Modified
by Kanchon Dasmahapatra. Main difference is using the SBF1 restriction enzyme which
is a low-frequency cutter.

### Overview of the method

* Individual DNA samples are first digested with restriction enzyme SBFI.

* Individually barcoded P1 adapters are ligated to compatible ends of each digested DNA sample.

* The uniquely barcoded samples are then pooled into multiplexed libraries that will consist of a maximum of 16 individual DNA's.

* Each pooled library is sheared to an optimal size of ~ 200-600bp followed by gel size selection. (or Pippin pred)

* Libraries are then blunted, followed by A-tailing and P2 adapter ligation.

* Finally, libraries are enriched, and can be tagged with a second unique barcode during PCR amplification. 


### General advice for Lab-newbies

* Work on ice if possible. Sample and reagents are precious and you don´t want 
them to degrade. If your lab doesn´t provide ice, just work with part of the samples
and have the rest in the fridge / freezer.

* Find a simple system to integrate your excel table with the plates 
and pipettes you are using. For example, when you prepare 8 samples in a column
on the plate, sort your excel table, your pipettes and your samples in the same way,
so you don´t have to think about the next step.

* Look at what the fluid in your pipette is doing! Often filter pipettes don´t suck up
properly because the filter touch the fluid. Or the sample itself is gloupy and that´s why
its not sucked up. So have an eye on the details.

* When preparing a Mastermix, use ~ 5 % more than required. When preparing a Mastermix
for 16 samples, just do it for 17 as you will usually lose a bit of fluid due to pipetting
unreliabilities. Control the rest liquid in you Mastermix after pipetting to check whether
you made any errors.

* Last but not least: stop labwork if you feel that your concentration fades away. Otherwise you
will make errors, believe me.
